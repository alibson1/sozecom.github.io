In Islamic terms,\u00a0<em><i>Waqf<\/i><\/em>\u00a0refers to a religious endowment i.e. a voluntary and irrevocable dedication of one\u2019s wealth or a portion of it (wealth) \u2013 in cash or kind (such as a house or a garden), and its disbursement for\u00a0<em><i>shari\u2019ah<\/i><\/em>\u00a0compliant projects (such as mosques or religious schools etc)<\/p><p><strong><b>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WAQF AND CHARITY<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>Waqf is a permanent donation. Once a waqf is established, it can never be donated as a gift, inheritance, or be sold. Disbursement of its returns is done in accordance with the endower\u2019s wishes. Charity, on the other hand, is a broader concept; it encompasses alms, grant, inheritance, loan, waqf etc.<\/p><p>Forms of Waqf<\/p><p><strong><b>Family Waqf:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The endower dedicates waqf to his family, children, relatives or others. Upon the death of the beneficiaries, this type of waqf can be transformed into a charitable one at the endower\u2019s request.<\/p><p><strong><b>Charitable Waqf:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The endowment is designated to help the poor, orphans, widows and any other charitable causes.<\/p><p><strong><b>Joint Waqf:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>This waqf is a combination of both family and charitable waqf.<\/p><p>Goals of Waqf<\/p><p><strong><b>General Goal:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>Waqf plays a paramount role in needy and general societies or in unforeseen circumstances in particular. It aids in the developmental process by helping the needy ones mentioned above, establishing Mosques and social-welfare institutions such as schools, healthcare centers, and centers for people with special needs.<\/p><p><strong><b>Personal Goal:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>People are driven to perform good deeds for human nature or Religious, social, family-related and some other reasons.\u00a0there\u2019s no \u00a0perfect time to give, but there are always people out\u00a0here and \u00a0there in need of help,\u00a0while\u00a0interest are rising, the economy is in the gloom time or\u00a0experiencing financial difficulties of your own, the reality is that when would you donate.<\/p><p>Tenets of Waqf<\/p><p>The majority of Islamic scholars agreed that waqf is a\u00a0<em><i>Shari\u2019a<\/i><\/em>\u00a0(Islamic law) compliant charity. They referred to general and specific evidence.<\/p><p>In the general evidence, about charity and waqf, Allah \u2013 Exalted be He \u2013 revealed in the Glorious Qur\u2019an that \u201c<em><i>By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness \u2013 Paradise), unless you spend in the Allah\u2019s<\/i><\/em>\u201d (Q3:92). Also, Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (PBUM) said \u201c<em><i>When a son of Adam dies, his good deeds stop except for three things; righteous child who prays for him, ongoing-charity, or useful knowledge\u2026<\/i><\/em>\u201d. In specific evidence, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) used to established waqf himself, and he regarded waqf as one of the best form of charity. Furthermore, Abdullahi Ibn Umar reported that \u201cUmar acquired land in Khaibar. He approached the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and sought his advice in regard to it. He said to Allah\u2019s Messenger, I have never acquired anything more valuable for me than this, so what do you command I do with it? Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: If you like, you may keep the corpus intact and give its produce as\u00a0<em><i>sadaqah Jariyyah<\/i><\/em>\u00a0(continuous charity). So Umar made\u00a0<em><i>sadaqah<\/i><\/em>\u00a0declaring that the property must not be sold or inherited or given away. The produce should be given to poor, the needy, the nearest of kin, for emancipation of slaves, as well as wayfarers\u2026\u201d Narrated in Sahih Muslim.<\/p><p>Conditions of Waqf<\/p><p>The waqf has three components; the endower, the endowment (waqf), and the beneficiary.<\/p><p><strong><b>The endower:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><b>The endowment:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><b>The beneficiary:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The Legality of Waqf In Islam<\/p><p>Waqf is a form of charity for the sake of Allah. It is lawful because it aids in human sustainable development. It also seeks to empower the Muslim and non-muslim alike. Waqf is also a beautiful loan to Allah \u2013 Exalted \u2013 Who shall reward the endower granted it is done with pure intention.<\/p><p>Waqf: Rules and Conditions<\/p><p>Waqf has three components: The endower, the endowment (waqf), and the beneficiary.<\/p><p><strong><b>The Endower.<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The endower must confirm his\/her decision to grant an endowment and designate its beneficiary either verbally or in writing. One can also have a tangible evidence on his\/her endowments such as a built mosque or cemetery.<\/p><p>Endowment must be granted with full determination and as a final decision; in other words, a promissory and conditional endowments are not accepted. Further, endowment is irrevocable and for an unlimited time. Most scholars agree that endowment cannot be valid for a limited period. The Maliki School, however, is the only one that accepts the limited time endowment.<\/p><p><strong><b>Qualifications of the Endower.<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The endower must be an adult with free will. His\/her decision to grant an endower must be a personal one. i.e is not imposed on him\/her by anyone.<\/p><p><strong><b>Endowment.<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>Endowment funds or assets must be in compliance with Shari\u2019ah. For instance, wine cannot be considered an endowment. Endowment can be either in cash or in kind such as estates and stocks. Since an endowment is a continuous charity (Sadaqat al-Jariah), it must be permanent and non perishable. Therefore, food cannot be endowed. Moreover, the endowment can b e a part of an undivided joint estate granted its percentage is known (such as 25% of the estate). Endower has the right to increase his waqf with time by additional funds or in kind.<\/p><p><strong><b>Requirement related to beneries<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The beneficiary can be an individual (s) or an institution (s) which is awarded the income generated from investing the Waqf. Waqf must also be designated to\u00a0<em><i>Shari\u2019ah<\/i><\/em>\u00a0compliant deeds or people such as printing the Holy Quran, or helping the needy, the poor, the relatives.<\/p><p><strong><b>Self-endowment:<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>Endowment is permitted to earn the whole or some of the income generated by the waqf during his\/her life. Upon one\u2019s death, the income will be spent on the beneficiary designated by the endower.<\/p><p><strong><b>ENDOWMENT OF AN INDEBTED OR TERMINALLY ILL PERSON<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>If an individual is in debts and is placed under guardianship per the debtors\u2019 request, one\u2019s endowment will only come into effect upon the debtors\u2019 approval. In Islamic law, paying up one\u2019s debts is an obligation and a voluntary charitable donation. The same condition applies to the terminally ill person. Such person is not entitled to establish a waqf until all his debts have been paid or upon the debtors\u2019 approval.<\/p><p><strong><b>WAQF AND INHERITANCE<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0Waqf can be established during ones\u2019 life. It can also be stated in the will. One can designate one third of his\/her money for Waqf. In case the amount allocated for waqf is more than the third of the inheritance, it is up to the heirs to accept or reject establishing the waqf inheritance. In such case, the remaining funds or assets must be distributed to the heirs.<\/p><p>Waqf Executor<\/p><p>The executor is appointed by the endower to ensure that his\/her wishes are executed. The executor is entitled to overview the waqf, its investment and its disbursement to the beneficiary.<\/p><p><strong><b>EXECUTOR REQUIREMENTS<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The executor must have the following qualifications: \u2013<\/p><ul><li>Be muslim.<\/li><li>Be mentally sane.<\/li><li>Be matured in age.<\/li><li>Be just; a trustworthy individual who obeys Allah and is of good ethics and conduct.<\/li><li>Be wise; follow the endower\u2019s interest.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong><b>DUTIES RELATED TO EXECUTORS<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>It is the executor\u2019s responsibility to protect the waqf and maximize its investment:<\/p><ul><li>Upkeep the waqf: undertake all maintenance and repair aimed at protecting and preserving the waqf from any damage.<\/li><li>Fulfill the endower\u2019s wishes.<\/li><li>Defend the waqf rights in any legal disputes.<\/li><li>Pay up waqf related debts.<\/li><li>Spend the waqf revenues on the designated beneficiary and abide by the set date for disbursement, except in certain cases such as the need to pay up some waqf related debts.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong><b>PERMISSIBLE AND PROHIBITED ACTS UPON THE EXECUTORS<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The executor has to right to perform any deeds beneficial to the waqf and to the endower within the conditions laid down by the endower. Prohibited acts are those that might impact negatively on the waqf such as: \u2013<\/p><ul><li>Lease the waqf for oneself or for one his children which is considered an act of nepotism.<\/li><li>Consider the waqf a guarantee for the executor\u2019s loan, in other words cover the payments of the executor\u2019s loan from the waqf revenues.<\/li><li>Pawn the waqf.<\/li><li>Lend the waqf to an individual or an institution other than the designated beneficiary.<\/li><li>Reside or have someone reside free of charge or for a minimal rent in the waqf estates.<\/li><li>\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><p><strong><b>FEES RIGHTS OF EXECUTORS<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>It is permissible to award the executor monthly or yearly fees, or a portion of the waqf revenues. If the endower did not mention such fees, the judge has the right to grant the executor fair fees in the same range of other executors.\u00a0<\/p><p><strong><b>THE REMOVAL OF EXECUTORS<\/b><\/strong><\/p><p>The executor can be removed by the endower or the judge for certain reasons. Such reasons may include disloyalty and loss of competence. Removal will come into effect once the executor is officially informed. Thus, any act taken by the executor prior to his knowledge is considered valid.<\/p><p><strong><b>MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF WAQF<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0The majority of Islamic scholars agree that maintaining and repairing the waqf is the major executor\u2019s responsibility. It is even most important and must therefore precede spending the revenues on the beneficiary. Since waqf is a continuous donation, the executor must ensure its sustainability.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-25 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-ff1e8e9\" data-id=\"ff1e8e9\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Waqaf Endowment (Waqf) Definition of Endowment Waqf, in Arabic language, means to stop, contain, or preserve.
